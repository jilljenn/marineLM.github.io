I am a Postdoctoral researcher at INRIA in the Parietal team, working on supervised learning with missing values, with GaÃ«l Varoquaux, Julie Josse and Erwan Scornet.

I did my PhD at Mines ParisTech and Institut Curie under the supervision of Jean-Philippe Vert and Andrei Zinovyev. My PhD aimed at developing new representations and efficient algorithms for machine learning on genomic data.
