Welcome to my home page!

I am a Postdoctoral researcher at INRIA in the Parietal team, working on supervised learning with missing values, with [GaÃ«l Varoquaux](http://gael-varoquaux.info), [Julie Josse](http://juliejosse.com) and [Erwan Scornet](https://erwanscornet.github.io/).

I did my PhD at Mines ParisTech and Institut Curie under the supervision of [Jean-Philippe Vert](http://members.cbio.mines-paristech.fr/~jvert/) and [Andrei Zinovyev](https://auranic.github.io/). My PhD aimed at developing new representations and efficient algorithms for machine learning on genomic data.

Here is [my CV](/files/CV_long_english.pdf).
