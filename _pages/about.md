Welcome to my home page!

I am a Postdoctoral researcher at INRIA in the Parietal team, working on supervised learning with missing values, with [http://gael-varoquaux.info](GaÃ«l Varoquaux), [http://juliejosse.com](Julie Josse) and [https://erwanscornet.github.io/](Erwan Scornet).

I did my PhD at Mines ParisTech and Institut Curie under the supervision of [http://members.cbio.mines-paristech.fr/~jvert/](Jean-Philippe Vert) and [https://auranic.github.io/](Andrei Zinovyev). My PhD aimed at developing new representations and efficient algorithms for machine learning on genomic data.

For more information, here are a long CV and a short CV.
